Today I did 1D DP, was able to do it nicely, feeling more better
I did some research on how react actually works, why better ----> VDOM, Fibres, Diffing, Reconcilation


Tomorrow do better
1. Parallel runtime in modern processors, lecture User level threads + revise second half
2. DP (2D)
3. React practice first + then theory(understand fibres gitrepo top down ) (its not about everything its just about knowing everything about 1 thing)
